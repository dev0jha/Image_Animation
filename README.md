# CSS 3D Image Carousel

This project showcases a 3D image carousel built entirely with HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript.

## Features

- 3D rotating image slider using only CSS animations and transforms
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Custom fonts and stylish layout
- Background and model images for enhanced visual appeal

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file containing the carousel and content
- `style.css` – CSS for layout, animation, and styling
- `images/` – Folder containing background, model, and carousel images
- `video.mp4` – (Optional) Video asset for the project

## How It Works

The carousel uses CSS variables to position each image in a circular layout with `rotateY` and `translateZ`. The `.slider` element is animated with a keyframe to rotate the carousel infinitely.


## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the carousel.

## Credits

- Fonts from [CDN Fonts](https://www.cdnfonts.com/)
- Images are placeholders; replace them with your own for customization.
